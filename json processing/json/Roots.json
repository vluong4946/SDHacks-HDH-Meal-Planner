UCSD Housing Dining Hospitality Services strives to provide our customers with the most accurate, current nutrition and allergen information present in our menu items on campus. The nutritional information and allergens identified for each of our items have been auto-generated from our recipe management database system. However, there is always a chance that changes have occurred in the manufacturing of products off-site, which may occur without our knowledge. Similarly, there is always a possibility that certain ingredients may be substituted on the actual day of preparation. Thus, we cannot guarantee that a particular dish or item is free of a certain ingredient. Particularly for those individuals with sensitive food allergies, we want to inform you of this risk. We are in the process of verifying our nutrition information and allergens. Should you have any questions, please contact our nutrition team at HDHdiningmenus@ucsd.edu.",
